# Overview

This is a calculator app I decided to make to help me learn how android studio worked. I chose a 
calculator because I wanted to work with buttons and layouts. I always was curious about how easy
it might be since programs already have calculator functions built into them. Turns out though, it 
was rather difficult. As of right now, it is not nearly done.

# Development Environment

This app just uses basic android studio with the main file being written in kotlin. No extra
libraries were used.

# Useful Websites

This tutorials helped me a lot with this project.
